  <h4>What my original instructions were:</h4>
 
 ```
-01- Construct a simple illustration of an ordinary lightbulb.
      a) It should include a cap, a round glass bulb, two lead wires, and a filament.
      b) It will be ON: make both the bulb and the filament glow in hues of yellow.
      c) Make it scalable.
      d) This is the LIT BULB.
-02- Duplicate the LIT BULB.
      a) This bulb will be OFF: make both the bulb and the filament dark yet contrast against the background.
      b) This is the DIM BULB.
-03- When you run on even seconds, load the DIM BULB.
      When you run on odd seconds, load the LIT BULB.
```

Origially, I really wanted to animate the scene by progressing frames via refreshing the browser. The assignment is clear to write out instructions for a static image. The lightbulb approach takes the concept of my first and scales it to fit the deliverables... I hope.
