```
1. Load Pattern and Decoration Movement construct.
- Use this as your inspiration to accomplish the following.
2. Stretch a canvas 2 squares wide by 2 squares high. 
- Imagine assigning a number to each square 1-4. 
  - #1 is the top, left square.
  - #2 is the top, right square.
  - #3 is the bottom, left square.
  - #4 is the bottom, right square.
- in the bottom, left corner, draw a small arc and fill it white.
3. For Square #1:
- Paint it black. 
- Add three white stars in the top, right corner of this square.
- Simplify their shape into small plus signs. 
4. For Square 2:
- Paint it deep red.
- From the top, right corner of this square, make a turquoise-colored cone that almost fills the frame.
- Add a thick black strip around the middle of the cone. Make it about 25% of the height of the cone.
- Add a second black strip. About 20% of the size of the first.
- Fill the bottom, left corner yellow.
5. For Square 3
- Paint it magenta.
- In the top, right corner, draw a small arc and paint it white.
6. For Square 4
- Paint it white.
7. For the span of Squares 3 & 4
- In their middle, coming up from the bottom, paint half a black circle that arcs from mid-point of Square 3 to mid-point of Square 4. Only half of the circle should appear on the canvas. 
- Shift to the right, a bit smaller than the black circle, and paint a white semi-circle. 
- Fill most of the white semi-circle with turquoise - all but a small strip along the bottom and a small gap at the top. 
- Inside the small white strip, paint two thin rectangles. One on the left side of the white strip, another on the right. Offset both rectangles so they do not touch the sides. 
- Inside the turquoise semi-circle with a haircut, draw an inverted equilateral triangle from the center point. Just make black strokes, don't fill.
- Inside the turquoise semi-circle, bisect the equilateral triangle. Fill the right side deep red.
- ( a ) Along the bottom of Square 3, the very top edge of a black semi-circle that reaches from the white semi-circle to almost the left edge of Square 3. The arc should be about 1/6th the height of the box. 
- ( b ) In the black arc, paint a white arc. 
- ( c ) Along the white semi-circle, trace along the path until a small gap forms away from the black & white arcs. Repeat a and b above.
- Repeat a,b,c five (5) times. Each time, spacing each arc a small space away from the previous. Scale the LENGTH of the arcs to fit within the squares. Don't scale their width.

No doubt my instructions are not as poetic as yours. 

It's a beautiful piece and post. I was really happy to see an abstract approach. 

If I were to make one suggestion: I know you're limited to the functions of markdown, but it felt odd to read your "other Thoughts on Instructions" in code format. Does that make sense?

Really well done.
